This is an estore that can read an already existing list of products and lets users
add new products to the list. The user can also search for any existing products. The
way they choose is from a menu that appears at the start and mini menus that pop up
waiting for the user's input to keep moving forward. This version of the estore uses 
HashMaps and a superclass, unlike the last version of the assignment. The extra addition to this store is that now there is a GUI involved. The user has a many and click on buttons and scroll to read text.

**Sometimes it does glitch and makes some labels appear before they are supposed to or makes some panels take up the whole screen. To fix this just restart the program. ***

Test Plan:
I just kept adding small bits of code from the original assignment and kept testing
to make sure everything worked, then I added small bits of the new code one by one 
and kept testing to make sure the changes didn't cause any major errors. I made sure
to check if the functions got input from the file and checked to see if the file got 
output from the user and saved it. I kept experimenting with the GUI and added little pieces one by one to make sure it worked and looked presentable.
